# ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System (KNN)

## Overview  
This project implements a **Book Recommendation System** using the [Book-Crossings dataset](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/), which contains **1.1 million ratings** (scale 1â€“10) of **270,000 books** by **90,000 users**.  

The system uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to recommend books similar to a given book, based on user rating patterns.  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
The Book-Crossings dataset includes:  
- **BX-Books.csv** â†’ Book metadata (ISBN, title, author)  
- **BX-Users.csv** â†’ User IDs & demographics (not used here)  
- **BX-Book-Ratings.csv** â†’ Userâ€“book ratings  

---

## ðŸ›  Data Preparation  
1. **Filtering**  
   - Removed users with fewer than **200 ratings**  
   - Removed books with fewer than **100 ratings**  

2. **Merging**  
   - Ratings merged with book metadata (`isbn â†’ title`)  

3. **Matrix Creation**  
   - Built a **bookâ€“user rating matrix** (rows = books, columns = users)  
   - Filled missing values with `0`  
   - Converted to a sparse matrix for efficiency

## ðŸ¤– Model  
- **Algorithm**: K-Nearest Neighbors (`sklearn.neighbors.NearestNeighbors`)  
- **Metric**: Cosine distance (measures rating pattern similarity)  
- **Steps**:  
  1. Input a book title  
  2. Locate it in the matrix  
  3. Find top 5 nearest books  
  4. Return list of recommendations with distances

## ðŸ“Š Example Output  

```python
get_recommends("The Queen of the Damned (Vampire Chronicles (Paperback))")
